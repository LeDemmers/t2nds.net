## What is, Vintage Story?

> Vintage Story is an **uncompromising** wilderness **survival** **sandbox** game inspired by **eldritch** horror themes. Find yourself in a ruined world reclaimed by nature and permeated by unnerving temporal disturbances. Relive the advent of human civilization, or take your own path.
