### How do I get started?

- You will need to get yourself a [copy of the game](https://www.vintagestory.at/), if you don't have one already!

- Next, you will want to ensure you are on the same version as our server. Check below.

- Now you will load up the game, and figure out your settings. Don't worry about your keybinds as of much yet.

- Next, you will find the server:

	1.  Click "Multiplayer"

	2. Click "Browse public servers"

	3. In "Search.." type in "TSSN"

	4. You will see "EN TSSN - PIONEERS PvE Arise Civilization! New Player Friendly"

	5. Click on it, then click "Add to Favorites", then press "Join Server"

	6. It will then start the mod downloading process. Once finished, you will connect to the server.
